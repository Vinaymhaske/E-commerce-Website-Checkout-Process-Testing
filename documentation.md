Include sample data files (e.g., CSV, JSON) containing test scenarios, test inputs, and expected outcomes.
Use this data to parameterize the test scripts and facilitate reusability and maintainability.

Include sample test execution reports or screenshots showcasing the results of the checkout process testing.
Highlight any defects or issues identified during testing.
